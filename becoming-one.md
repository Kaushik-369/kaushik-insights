To become one—with nature, with art, with thought—is the soul's quiet revolution. It is not merging and losing, but returning and remembering.

When I draw, I become the brush. When I think, I become the sky—expansive, open, limitless. When I walk through the forest, I don’t walk in it—I become it. I echo the rustle of leaves, the call of birds, the breath of the earth.

Becoming one is dissolving the illusion of separateness and seeing creation as an extension of the self. It is the first principle of the Renaissance spirit: to unify the fragmented.

And in doing so, I come closer to what it means to be whole.
