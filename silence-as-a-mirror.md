In a world brimming with voices, opinions, and noise, silence becomes my sacred mirror. It reflects not what others say I am, but who I truly am beneath all the layers. 

In silence, I see my fears without judgment, my dreams without distortion, and my mind without noise. It is the only space where the self gets a voice that the world cannot interrupt.

It teaches me to trust intuition more than instruction, essence more than performance. The world speaks to control; silence teaches to listen, reflect, and create from within.

It teaches what the world forgets: that our being is more important than our doing.
